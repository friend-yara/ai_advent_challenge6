Context:

I am participating in the AI Advent Challenge.
Main goal: structured learning of AI and LLMs through building real systems.

Current phase:
Week 2 — Context & Memory.
Day 7 completed.

Environment:
- Ubuntu 24.04 (VDS, SSH)
- Python 3.12
- venv (.venv)
- OpenAI Responses API via requests (no SDK)

Architecture:
- CLI single-agent loop
- agent.py + llm_agent_cli.py
- Stage-based flow: IDLE / PLAN / EXECUTE / REVIEW
- External system_prompt.txt
- Limited history window

Memory:
- Persistent state in state.toon
- TOON Spec v3.0 (toons library)
- Automatic load on startup
- Automatic save after each turn
- Conversation survives restarts

Constraints:
- Minimal dependencies
- Explicit context control
- SSH-friendly
- Token efficiency

Goal now:
Continue Day 8 / next task.
Focus on improving context and memory management.

Respond concisely and focus on implementation.
